NAME

    Parse::USDASR - Parse USDA Food nutrition standard reference data
    files.

SYNOPSIS

      use Parse::USDASR;
    
      my $parser = Parse::USDASR->new;
      $parser->io(\*STDIN);
      $parser->each_line(
          sub {
              my @fields = @_;
              # ... 
          }
      );

DESCRIPTION

    This module helps you parse the SR21 data files download-able from:

    http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=8964

METHODS

    new

      Constructor. Takes no args, returns a parser object. The next thing
      you should do is to call its io method and assign an IO stream.

    io( \*FH | $handle )

      Attribute accessor. You need to assign an io stream object before
      start parsing. You can pass an reference to file handle:

          open FH, "< FOOD_DES.txt";
          $parser->io( \*FH );

      Or anything that can be placed inside of the diamond operator (<>):

          # An tied IO::All object
          $parser->io( io("FOOD_DES.txt")->tie );

    each_line(sub { ... })

      For each line read from the io stream, call your call back with
      parsed fields in @_. Consult the sr21_doc.pdf file for field
      definition.

        $parser->each_line(
            sub {
                my @fields = @_;
                # ... 
            }
        );

    field_names_for( $file_name )

      Returns the list of field names for the given file. The field
      definition is looked up by file name:

          @field_names = Parse::USDASR->field_names_for('WEIGHT.txt');
          # NDB_No, Seq, Amount, Msre_Desc, Gm_Wgt, Num_Data_Pts, Std_Dev

      Again, consult the sr21_doc.pdf file for field definition.
